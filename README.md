# Image Classification
## Introduction
Image classification is a computer vision task that involves categorizing images into predefined classes or categories. It has numerous applications, including facial recognition, object detection, and medical imaging. In this project, we explore image classification using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
Our goal is to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into different categories. We start by collecting and preprocessing the data, which involves gathering a large dataset of labeled images and preparing them for training. We then train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on the dataset using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. We experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies to achieve the best performance.

Once we have trained our model, we evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. We also visualize the model's predictions and examine cases where the model misclassifies images. This analysis helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model and identify areas for improvement.

## Technologies Used
Python: We use Python as the primary programming language for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

TensorFlow : We use this popular deep learning librarie to build and train our CNN model.

Jupyter Notebook: We use Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration, visualization, and documentation.

## Conclusion
In this project, we explore image classification using deep learning techniques. We collect and preprocess a large dataset of labeled images, train a deep convolutional neural network, evaluate its performance using various metrics, and deploy the model to a web application. We demonstrate the potential of deep learning for solving complex image classification problems and highlight areas for future research and development.
